# Coursera_Capstone

This Capstone project that I am studying for the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate with Coursera. It will be made up of different sectionswhich will be submitted to be marked. The exercise is to look at different regions of Toronto by Post Code and location and then using an API find what are the best places to live.
